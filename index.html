                Imperative programs use many lines of code to describe specific steps to accomplish a sought after result- the flow control -the HOW to do things. It often uses statements in code. <br> Declarative programs abstract the flow control process and use lines of code to describe the data flow -WHAT to do. It uses expressions in code more often
